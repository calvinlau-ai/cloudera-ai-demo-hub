# Cloudera AI Demo Hub - Master Catalog
# This file is the single source of truth for all demos.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# HOW TO USE:
# 1. Content 'catalog.yml' file
# 2. For each demo, customize:
#    - 'owner': Replace with the GitHub username of the demo creator (e.g., "@jane").
#    - 'description': Refine to accurately describe your specific implementation.
#    - 'allowed_teams': Adjust based on who should have access (sales-team, presales-team, ai-engineers).
# 3. Add new demos by copying a full '- id:' block and updating all fields.
